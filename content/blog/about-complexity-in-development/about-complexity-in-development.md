In 2004/2005, I was in my last year of study. The dot-com crash [^1]


At this time, Java, through its web application offering J2EE [^2](as it was named at the time) was all the rage in the enterprise world.
J2EE applications were hosted on overpriced middleware such as IBM WebSphere Application Server, BEA Weblogic or JBoss, and those servers implemented a set of APIs called EJB.

For several developers, EJBs were the golden standard of enterprise applications at the time. Those were an improvement about CORBA middlewares (which were also overpriced middlewares), that were trendy in the 90s.

Sure, you could use a framework based on JSP [^3] such as Struts and  hosted on Tomcat [^4] to develop web applications but for several Java professionals at the time, it was seen as the entry level / cheap compromise.

I do remember I felt quite intimidated when I was learning about EBJ. A lot of things were still unclear for me at the time, but I guess it was normal. However most of all, it felt complex. verbose



During 2005, a new kid on the block gained a lot of traction : Spring, on top of offering a Dependency Injectionn framework, also published a web framework, "Spring MVC", that basically killed the EJB 2.1 market.




By today standard, every developer would call this programming model bloated. Not in the sense that it did not address some concerns or was not an improvement about past and forgotten techs. But in the sense it was overly complex.

Of course, at the time, this EJB model was praised by a lot of professionals. Some because if was their bread and butter. Some because EJBs were nonetheless an improvement over the tools and technologies they used in the 90s.

I do remember that when the EJBs got out of fashion, some people that were quote loud in praising them in the past were as loud to critisize them a few years later...

## Complexity as a skill metric

Later, I came to understand that complexity was the skill metric. If you can

Actually, at the time, simplicity was already praised by developers[^5]. But there was a discrepency between the corporate dynamics and the requirements of the job. At the time in big companies, how did you prove your worth ? Than you were more skilled than your colleague or the junior that joined the team ?


Even in the 2010s, I was applying for a job when the interviewer warned me "The codebase is complex, it's not an entry level job, we need some skilled people".


## And now ?


20 years later, this landscape has dramatically changed. I do not

From afar, you can tell part of this complexity has been offloaded to DevOps.

And yet... I see
While some concerns such as security are now   have - rightly so.
Actually, some mechanism are still the same. People praising

## Will AI save us ?

Whithin a couple years.
While it's too early to say whether the LLMs will kill the developers job, I

THere will always be the need to prove this

[Microsoft .NET was gaining traction but still behind.   PHP was for "beginners", Python was and C/C++ were quietly .]

The point here is not to delve into details, but their programming model was overly verbose and complex.
